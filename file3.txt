The Exile

    By Ralph Waldo Emerson


    FROM THE PERSIAN OF KERMANI

    In Farsistan the violet spreads
    Its leaves to the rival sky;
    I ask how far is the Tigris flood,
    And the vine that grows thereby?

    Except the amber morning wind,
    Not one salutes me here;
    There is no lover in all Bagdat
    To offer the exile cheer.

    I know that thou, O morning wind!
    O'er Kernan's meadow blowest,
    And thou, heart-warming nightingale!
    My father's orchard knowest.

    The merchant hath stuffs of price,
    And gems from the sea-washed strand,
    And princes offer me grace
    To stay in the Syrian land;

    But what is gold for, but for gifts?
    And dark, without love, is the day;
    And all that I see in Bagdat
    Is the Tigris to float me away.
