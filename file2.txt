Merlin I

    By Ralph Waldo Emerson


    Thy trivial harp will never please
    Or fill my craving ear;
    Its chords should ring as blows the breeze,
    Free, peremptory, clear.
    No jingling serenader's art,
    Nor tinkle of piano strings,
    Can make the wild blood start
    In its mystic springs.
    The kingly bard
    Must smite the chords rudely and hard,
    As with hammer or with mace;
    That they may render back
    Artful thunder, which conveys
    Secrets of the solar track,
    Sparks of the supersolar blaze.
    Merlin's blows are strokes of fate,
    Chiming with the forest tone,
    When boughs buffet boughs in the wood;
    Chiming with the gasp and moan
    Of the ice-imprisoned flood;
    With the pulse of manly hearts;
    With the voice of orators;
    With the din of city arts;
    With the cannonade of wars;
    With the marches of the brave;
    And prayers of might from martyrs' cave.
